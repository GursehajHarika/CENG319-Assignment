# Code 

before you could start using this Library,there are some things that need to be done 


Either by going into 

First, go into the AndroidManifest.XML
and add the following permission,

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />


under Gradle Scripts, go in build.gradle and add 

    implementation 'com.squareup.picasso:picasso:2.71828'

under dependecies.Click on Sync button located on the top which looks like <img width="51" alt="syncgradleicon" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43185907/49630410-0356fb00-f9bc-11e8-891a-b667deff6c84.png">
 
 Note :- There is a Bug in the Picasso library, Any file larger than 10MB willl have a problem with loading your picture.
 
 then in the XML file, create a ImageView with all the necessary components, youre code should look somthing like this 
 
 
  <ImageView
        android:id="@+id/imageView"
        android:layout_width="226dp"
        android:layout_height="272dp"
        android:layout_marginBottom="8dp"
        android:layout_marginEnd="8dp"
        android:layout_marginStart="8dp"
        android:layout_marginTop="8dp" />
 
 Now in the main Java class initalize the view,
 
     public ImageView imager;
   
      imager = (ImageView)findViewById(R.id.imageView);
