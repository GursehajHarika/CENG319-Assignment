 Picasso Library 

# Introduction 

Pictures make everything more appealing, especially in applications. Picasso image library makes the process of adding that magical element of having a picture in your application easy. Usually in a line of code. In picasso library, pictures from the Internet, Data and even images from the memory can all be displayed. This is a developer's dream component to have when dealing with images. it even automates the process of caching images from disk and memory. Image transformation memory use is even reduced when this library is impliment and used.

# History

This is a fairly new component for android released, Copyrighted by Square.Inc. and lisenced under the Apache License, Version 2.0 in 2013, the license can be priviewed [here](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).Before the release of version 2.6.0, the library had a bug and was unable to download images of size bigger than 10MB.


# The Major Methods and Code For Implementation 

before you could start using the Picasso Library, there are some things that need to be done 


Either by pressing the shift key twice and searching for "Project Structure", 

on the left side toolbar, under Modules choose app.

and Select Dependecies on the top option bar.

## OR 

Go into the AndroidManifest.XML
and add the following permissions,

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />


under Gradle Scripts, go in build.gradle and add 

    implementation 'com.squareup.picasso:picasso:2.71828'

under dependecies.Click on Sync button located on the top which looks like <img width="51" alt="syncgradleicon" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43185907/49630410-0356fb00-f9bc-11e8-891a-b667deff6c84.png">
 
 ### Note :- There is a Bug in the Picasso library for versions before 2.6, Any file larger than 10MB willl have a problem with loading your picture. It is advised to use the latest version available
 
 then in the XML file, create a ImageView with all the necessary components, youre code should look somthing like this 

    <ImageView
        android:id="@+id/imageView"
        android:layout_width="226dp"
        android:layout_height="272dp"
        android:layout_marginBottom="8dp"
        android:layout_marginEnd="8dp"
        android:layout_marginStart="8dp"
        android:layout_marginTop="8dp"
        app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toBottomOf="@+id/textView"
        app:layout_constraintVertical_bias="0.052" />


 Now in the main Java class initalize the view,
 
 
     public ImageView imager;
     

and add this in OnCreate,
   
      imager = (ImageView)findViewById(R.id.imageView);

Finally ,in order to impliment the Picasso library add the following lines of code


      Picasso.get().load(URL).into(imageview);
      

with URL being a String whose value is the link to the image you wish to load from.

if you want to load from the disk try this

        Picasso.get().load(R.mipmap.Image_name).into(imageview);


By Following these steps you should be able to sucessfully impliment Picasso Library.
 




# Example Project

Hereâ€™s the link for my project that shows how the Picasso library works.
this project has one image being loaded from the internet and one from disk.
